  <h1> SDLC Summary </h1>   

  <li>Our project journey began with the initiation phase, where we faced the challenge of defining the project scope and requirements. We collaborated to outline the objectives and functionalities of our application. Despite initial difficulties in narrowing down the scope, guidance from another group in the course helped us refine our focus, leading to a clearer understanding of our project goals.


   <br> <br>During the planning phase, each team member assumed roles and responsibilities based on our skills and expertise. Toby took charge of backend development, working closely with Alyssa from Indy-03 Purple to set up the Firestore database. We utilized libraries like NativeWind for efficient CSS styling. However, challenges arose in selecting and integrating appropriate libraries, such as the ReactNativeDropdown library, which impacted backend functionalities.
    <br><br>As we progressed into the execution phase, we encountered technical challenges in connecting the backend to the frontend. Toby dedicated extensive time to debugging API calls and refining the fetch script for retrieving drinks from the database. Despite our efforts, issues with parameter passing persisted, leading to setbacks in functionality during our demo at C-Day.
    
    <br><br>Throughout the SDLC, effective communication and collaboration were essential for overcoming challenges and maintaining project momentum. Regular meetings facilitated discussions on progress, obstacles, and realignment of priorities. Maximus played a crucial role in documentation and project management, ensuring clear records of our development process and facilitating team coordination.
    
    <br><br>Despite encountering setbacks, our enthusiasm for the project remained high, fueled by the valuable feedback and ideas received during the demo. Moving forward, we aim to address the remaining challenges and continue developing our application outside of school, guided by the lessons learned throughout the SDLC.
